# Generic API for IoT Developers - Abstract

• The project is about mutual communication between IoT devices and user. Typically, an IoT is a world-wide network of uniquely addressable, and interconnected objects, based on standard communication rules or protocols.

• The project is an API that acts has a generic scope for communication with any sort of hardware device irrespective of its functionality. This API helps developer (user) to control the device remotely. This API can be extended to predict the power consumption, over power usage and average life time of the device based on the previous data. Maintaining privacy and user-policies are also a few key aspects.

• Developers face difficulty in building an IoT based systems that provide communication between hardware devices (sensors) and servers. This API provides a communication between any hardware devices and servers. It’s make easier to develop an IoT based system by using this API. By using this API we get additional services such as user policies, sensor values monitoring, controlling the hardware devices, maintaining the data (by reading sensor values with minimum delay of 5 sec), plotting graphs from sensors data etc. We can Access those services throughout the world.
